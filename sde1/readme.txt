uA(L), rA(L), dA(L), lA(L) - return the length of the string if found in the
grammar. False otherwise.

sq - Returns true if in the grammar, containing any length of strings in uA, rA,
dA, and lA in that order.

sqA - Returns true if in sq and the length of each string in uA, rA, dA, and lA
are of equal length.

rectA --> Returns true if in sq and the length of uA and dA, and rA and lA are equal.

appU, appR, appD, appL - helper functions to add a string of length L of
"u", "r", "d", or "l".

grect - generates a string in rectA where uA and dA are of length A, and rA and
dA are of length B.

m30A(L) - a la uA

p240A(L) - same as m30A

eqtriA - returns true if in a concatenation of uA, m30A, and p240L and if the
length of each is equal.

one_shift - shifts the string once to the left
